          Over the past decade, educational reform has focused on "weeding out"
          teachers rather than developing them. We think it's time to turn professional
          development on its head by putting teachers at the center.

          <p>As the field promotes new structures and policies to support student-centered learning,
          we also have to redefine how teachers learn and develop their practice to ensure that
          all kids achieve.</p>
          <p>This involves creating a structured process for looking at teacher practice that makes
          the teacher the primary agent in his or her own learning.  It also requires a new set of
          tools for coaching and collaborating that focuses on providing meaningful feedback,
          self-reflection, and dialogue based on the needs and context of each teacher.  Simply
          watching online videos to hone your craft is a thing of the past.</p>
